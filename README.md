# webpack-library-boilerplate
This project helps transform your library codes into an UMD pattern file.

The UMD pattern is compatible in different environments, i.e. CommonJS, AMD, Node.js and as a global variable.

Write you code using CMD or ES6 module, and webpack will build a file that works everywhere.
